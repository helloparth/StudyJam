StudyJam
========

StudyJam is an iOS application intended to help students find friends to study
with.

What is StudyJam?
----------------
Upon opening the app, a user may set their "study level" (a measure of how
focused they are), which is then broadcasted to their friends. There is a map
screen which shows dots that represent studying friends. The dots are colored
according to their study level. There is also a screen that allows a user to
manage friends and study groups, as well as send text messages and phone calls
to those contacts.
